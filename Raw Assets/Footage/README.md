## Recreating Animations
I extracted the mp4 video of twitter and then used blender to extract the frames.
While the frames like good, on inspection it turns out the render version has been upscaled by 3x.
This means the version I'm extracting from the frames is 3x larger than the original. The 3x larger version
has artifacts and noise in the image. That makes it hard to edit the pixel art without making a mess. That's a problem
because I want to add addional animations.

To overcome this, I must manually recreate the original animations by hand. Once I have the recreated original animations
I can begin to optimize them for the game and add additional animations.
